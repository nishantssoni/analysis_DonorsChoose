# DonorsChoose.org Project Proposal Prediction

## Overview

Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, thousands of classroom requests can be brought to life with contributions of any amount.

Each year, DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals for classroom projects in need of funding. Currently, a large number of volunteers are required to manually screen these submissions before they can be approved and posted on the DonorsChoose.org website. With an anticipated increase to nearly **500,000 project proposals next year**, three critical challenges have emerged:

### Challenges
1. **Scaling Manual Processes**  
   How to efficiently scale existing resources to screen 500,000 projects quickly and accurately.

2. **Consistency in Project Vetting**  
   Ensuring consistent evaluation across volunteers to provide a better experience for teachers.

3. **Optimizing Volunteer Time**  
   Focusing volunteer efforts on applications that require the most attention and assistance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided by the Kaggle competition. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening/data).


## Project Goals

This project aims to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict whether a DonorsChoose.org project proposal will be approved. By analyzing the text of project descriptions alongside additional metadata about the project, teacher, and school, the algorithm can:

- **Auto-Approve Proposals**: Pre-screen applications and quickly auto-approve straightforward cases.
- **Focus Volunteer Efforts**: Identify applications that require detailed review, helping volunteers focus their time on complex cases.
- **Improve Efficiency**: Enable faster funding for teachers while reducing costs for DonorsChoose.org.

## Impact

By leveraging this machine learning solution, DonorsChoose.org can:
- Increase the number of teachers getting funded quickly.
- Reduce the cost of manual screening processes.
- Channel more funding directly into classrooms across the country.

## Repository Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore trends and insights from DonorsChoose.org datasets.
- **Text Analysis**: Use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze project descriptions.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict project approvals using advanced machine learning techniques.
- **Volunteer Optimization**: Identify projects that need detailed review to streamline volunteer efforts.
